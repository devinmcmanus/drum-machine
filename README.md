# Drum Machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running

The easiest way to run the Drum Machine is to use Docker Compose

`docker-compose up`

For those who like to tinker, you can build the Docker image yourself or use the npm / Yarn commands supported by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
